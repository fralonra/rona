At the fisrt few times, I just ran fsck and then reboot, but it failed today when my system tried to mount my home device, and systemctl status home.mount gave me the following errors:
home.mount: Mounting timed out. Terminating. home.mount: Mount process exited, code=killed, status=15/TERM home.mount: Failed with result 'timeout'. I noticed that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used persistent block device naming in my fstab, so I edited the file to change the naming by label.</description></item></channel></rss>
